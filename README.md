🙋🏻‍♂️Hi, I'm Claudio, I'm 29 and 70% of my body is made of movies.

😎Let me tell you a little about me!

❓I spent my childhood among the green Umbrian hills and the white South Tyrolean peaks
  without ever really reflecting on what was best for me and for my future,
  this led me to lose myself in a life and in a job that did not belong to me.

🧘🏻‍♂️Suffering has been my engine, I have known myself more in a year than in my entire life.

🌈So I CHOOSE to turn page and rewrite a new one in digital, starting with web and app development.
  But as a good multipotential, I will certainly not stop here!
